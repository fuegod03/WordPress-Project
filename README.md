Wordpress Project and Digital Agency

Unfortunately this folder is too big to publish on my Github website. But I'll be more than happy to show it to you in person.

This is the Wordpress version of the Digital Agency Website.
Made it following the "Theme Handbook" from Wordpress and respecting the "Template Hierarchy" from WordPress. 
Template is fully functioning and very flexible.

I used "PODS" to create this template because PODS allows me to replace information from the template using the Wordpress interface.
Also, "PODS" It's a JS framework that uses Ajax to replace information.
